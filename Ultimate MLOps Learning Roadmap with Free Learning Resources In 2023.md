## 2. Version Control for Machine Learning
The second step in this learning roadmap is to master version control/ and how it is used in machine learning. This includes understanding tools such as Git and how to use them to track changes to your code and models.

Working in production demands data scientists and machine learning engineers to know version control. Since you will be working in cooperation with other data scientists, data engineers, and software engineers, therefore it is important to be able to share your code and update it and also to follow up on their updates in a professional way.

## 3. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Tools

The third step is to learn about continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools and how they can automate building, testing, and deploying machine learning models.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are key practices in the field of MLOps that help to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying machine learning models. CI/CD tools are software tools that assist with these practices by providing automated pipelines for building, testing and deploying code. Some popular CI/CD tools include:

- Jenkins: an open-source CI/CD tool that is widely used and highly configurable.
- Travis CI: a popular cloud-based CI/CD tool that is easy to set up and use, particularly for open-source projects.
- GitLab CI: a CI/CD tool that is closely integrated with the GitLab version control system, making it easy to set up CI/CD pipelines for projects managed with GitLab.
- CircleCI: a cloud-based CI/CD tool that is popular for its easy setup and fast build times.
It’s important to choose the right CI/CD tool for your project, taking into consideration factors such as your team’s size, the complexity of your project, and your budget.

## 4. Infrastructure & Resource Management for Machine Learning

The fourth step is to learn about infrastructure and resource management tools for machine learning. This includes understanding how to provision and manage computing resources for training and deploying machine learning models and how to scale machine learning pipelines. Examples of infrastructure and resource management tools include:

- Kubernetes: This open-source system allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It can be particularly useful for managing machine learning workflows, as it allows you to easily scale up or down as needed.
- Docker: It is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This makes it easier to run the application on any other machine because everything it needs is contained in the package. Docker is often used in conjunction with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. It is also commonly used for developing and testing machine learning applications, as it allows you to create isolated environments with specific dependencies and packages.
- Amazon SageMaker: This fully-managed service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It includes tools for resource management, such as the ability to select the right hardware and automatically scale up or down as needed.
Google Cloud AI Platform: This cloud-based platform from Google includes tools for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models. It includes features such as automatic scaling and resource management to help you optimize your machine-learning workflow.

Overall, there are many tools available to help with infrastructure and resource management for machine learning, and the right choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

## 5. Machine Learning Monitoring & Observability Tools

The fifth step is to learn about monitoring and observability tools for machine learning. This includes understanding how to monitor the performance and health of machine learning models in production and troubleshooting and debugging issues that may arise. Examples of monitoring and observability tools include:

- TensorBoard: This tool, developed by Google, is a web-based visualization tool for machine learning experiments. It allows you to view metrics such as loss and accuracy, as well as visualize the structure of your model.
- Prometheus: This open-source monitoring system is designed to collect and store metrics from your applications and infrastructure. It includes a query language for analyzing the data and creating alerts.
- Datadog: This cloud-based monitoring platform allows you to track metrics, logs, and events from your applications and infrastructure. It includes tools for visualizing and analyzing data, as well as for creating alerts.
