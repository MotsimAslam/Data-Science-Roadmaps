# Simple But Effective Free Roadmap to Start A Career in Data Science & AI In 2023 #

Whether you’re a recent graduate or a professional looking to make a career change, the field of Data Science and AI offers a wide range of exciting and lucrative opportunities. In this article, I provide you with a free guide that will provide you with a clear and actionable plan for building the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in this rapidly growing field. By following the steps outlined in this roadmap, you’ll be well on your way to a successful and rewarding career in Data Science & AI.

This roadmap will take you to an intermediate level, and I truly believe you can land a job and start your career after finishing it. However, to go to an advanced level, you will need to take more in-depth courses, books, and research papers. As you will see, most of the courses will be from Coursera. The reason for this is that I believe they have one of the best quality practical and in-depth courses, and at the same time, you can apply for financial aid if you can not pay for the courses, so you can take them for free.

I have written an estimated time for each of the learning paths. This time is in days and weeks, and I assumed that you would learn 4 days for five days a week. So in total of 20 hours per week. Depending on this, you can calculate the time needed to finish this roadmap depending on your pace.

Data science methodology refers to the process or steps followed by data scientists to analyze and draw insights from data. This typically includes stages such as data exploration and cleaning, feature selection, model building and evaluation, and model deployment. Having a solid understanding of the data science process and methodology and what to expect in each step will help you structure your project properly and walk through it in a perfect way.

Data science literacy refers to the ability of an individual to understand and work with data science concepts and tools. These skills include knowledge of statistics, programming, and machine learning, as well as the ability to communicate and present data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders. It is important to have a wide look at the important skills you need to gain to be successful in this field.

## 3. Software Development
Data scientists are software engineers, first and foremost. They may not be coding machine learning models or natural language processing algorithms on a day-to-day basis, but the work they do as data scientists requires software engineering and programming skills to be able to apply all the data science project life cycles on the data.

Data scientists should also be able to understand users' needs and develop solutions for those needs, which is essential for any data scientist working in an organization.

While you can get a job and make tremendous contributions with only machine learning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can write good software to implement complex AI systems.

### These skills include:

* Programming fundamentals
* Data structures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames)
* Algorithms (including those related to databases and data manipulation),
* Software design
* Python essential libraries include TensorFlow or Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Pandas.
* Version Control

## 4. Mathematics for Machine Learning & Data Scientist

In the field of machine learning and data science, a strong foundation in mathematics is essential for understanding and implementing advanced algorithms. From linear algebra and multivariate calculus to probability and statistics, there are many different mathematical concepts that are important for success in these fields.

Mathematics is the foundation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, so it is important to have a strong mathematical background in these areas:

* Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various manipulations of them)
* Probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule, and hypothesis testing).
* Basic intuitive understanding of calculus
In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other methods to systematically explore a dataset is an underrated skill.

The math needed to do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, improved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.
