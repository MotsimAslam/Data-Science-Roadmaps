# Simple But Effective Free Roadmap to Start A Career in Data Science & AI In 2023 #

Whether you’re a recent graduate or a professional looking to make a career change, the field of Data Science and AI offers a wide range of exciting and lucrative opportunities. In this article, I provide you with a free guide that will provide you with a clear and actionable plan for building the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in this rapidly growing field. By following the steps outlined in this roadmap, you’ll be well on your way to a successful and rewarding career in Data Science & AI.

This roadmap will take you to an intermediate level, and I truly believe you can land a job and start your career after finishing it. However, to go to an advanced level, you will need to take more in-depth courses, books, and research papers. As you will see, most of the courses will be from Coursera. The reason for this is that I believe they have one of the best quality practical and in-depth courses, and at the same time, you can apply for financial aid if you can not pay for the courses, so you can take them for free.

I have written an estimated time for each of the learning paths. This time is in days and weeks, and I assumed that you would learn 4 days for five days a week. So in total of 20 hours per week. Depending on this, you can calculate the time needed to finish this roadmap depending on your pace.
